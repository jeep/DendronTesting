[[desired-state]]

[[todo#next-actions]]
## Todo list
embed todo file's "next actions" section
link to to list
+ [ ] Something I should do
+ [ ] These should mOve into the "todo" file once I process, if I haven't done it haven't done
+ [x] This is a completed item, it doesn't need to move, just lives here
+ [x] When I complete an item in my "todo" file, I want the completion to move to the daily when it was completed. 
* [ ] Any way to put items here automagically with a shortcut?


##  Random ideas - I don't really want these to always need a header, but maybe I just keep a section for this
+ I had this thought about a thing. It can just live here for now
+ I had this other thought that I think should have its own note
+ I looked at that one thing and it was cool. This just lives here
+ In order to do SomeCoolThing in Powershell- this should be in the shared reference location
```Powershell
Get-ChildItem NotReally
Get-ChildItem ACoolThing
```
+ I don't want to forget this and should be in its own note tiny note named "neato-thing"
+ In order to do some work thing using the Azure cli you do this- this should be in the intel tree
  + Log into suchandsuch.website
  + Gather this information
  + Execute these commands
    ~~~shell
    az cli cmd-to do-the-thing
    az cli cmd-to do-the-next-thing
    ~~~

## CoolMeeting1 - a recurring that I participate in
+ We talked about the thing
+ Decision made: We will do that thing
+ AR: Do my part of the thing This needs to turn into a ToDo in my todos
+ This should be refactored into m.coolmeeting1.date
+ with the content linked or embedded here

## Ad-hoc work session with Person1 
+ We talked about a thing. This should go to c.person1.date
+ Or is it good enough to just have people be in my shared vault and rely on backlinks?

## Project1
+ Random thought about Project1... what if we CLISP instead of C#? Bad idea?
+ I feel like I need the heading so it doesn't lost... but would prefer to capture it more linearly

## Ad-hoc work session with Person1
+ Normally this might be lower in the day's notes. This should also go to p.person1.date below the other note... and I might not really remember that there were two sessions with the person.
+ This spun off a potential project that I need to do and should get an entry into p.small in a section ProjectX

## Recurring Intake meeting
+ ProjectY was presented and looks like it should get fleshed out
> + Here are some notes
> + Lke seems great, right?
> + These should go into p.project-y
+ SmallTaskZ, which isn't related to any project, needs to get done. Create a TODO for this SmallTaskZ
+ ProjectA was presented and doesn't need to get done at all
+ All these should be in m.intake.date and leave a reference here

## 1:1 with Bossman (Recurring)
+ He suggested that I think about something or other
+ I updated Bossman on IssueXYZ, which is now resolved
+ ProjectC is behind schedule. Any requests from that team should be given priority
+ We talked about performance of Person2. I communicated that he's doing great. (Person2 should have a backlink to this)
+ All this needs to go in either m.1on1.bossman.date or c.bossman.date

## Code reviews
+ knocked out 6 reviews
+ link.to.review.com/reviewid1 ShortDescr
> + This one needs a lot of work. Set up a 1:1 with Person8 to discuss
+ 4 were small and easy
+ link.to.review.com/reviewid2 ShortDescr
> + Waiting for revision

## Project 1
+ Did xyz on Project 1. This probably came from the project next actions

+ Addendees: Person1, Person3, Person5, me
### Opens

*[ST]: Stupid Thing
  + No one knows, will consider this for a future disucssion
  + AR: Joe- Add ST to agenda for WW45 This I want in both m.meetings2.ars and my todo list
  + AR: Person1 - Prepare ST topic for WW45 This should go in m.meeting2.ars
### First Topic, I, Joe (Maybe "I" should be a link to m.types#Informational)
  + Presented status of Project1
  + Feedback from Person3- Can we pull this in a week to meet new request?
  + AR Joe: Evaluate backlog- what would slip? This should go to both m.meeting2.ars and my personal todo list
### Second Topic, D(me), Person1
  + Desire to do something
  + Doesn't looks like they considered situation1
  + AR: Person1, reevaluate to consider situation1. this should be added to m.meeting1.ars
  + Decision: Defer Ideally, I would like this in m.meeting2.decisions as "defer First topic" with a link to m.meeting1.date where this will go
### Third Topic, P, Person3  
  + We had a lot of discussion about the problem
  + Needs a focus team to look into it

    + Invitees: Bossman, Person1, Person2, Person3
    + Topic, D(Bossman), R: Person1
