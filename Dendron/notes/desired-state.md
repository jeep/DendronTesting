# Recommended agenda
1. Review desired state (Joe)
1. Feedback on desired state (mentor)
1. Set up and additional vaults and workspaces needed
1. Process sample notes [[daily.journal.2022.09.15]] (Joe drives, mentor navigates)
1. Set up next day (Joe drives, mentor navigates)
> 1. Migrate open tasks (might already be done when processing)
> 1. Todo setup
1. If time, maybe look at converting .org docs (C:\Users\jeepe\OneDrive\Documents\TestDendron\mostlysafe-to-share-org)

# Requirements
1. Separation of work stuff which cannot be committed externally and personal stuff which I don't want embedded in my work notes for privacy reasons
1. Able to see interactions with people (expect backlinks with a person note)
1. Easy use of project vaults to segregrate knowledge from project work
1. Daily notes captured easily and then reorganized as desired (leaving links in daily)

# Work Computer
## Work workspace 
+ Peacock to have special color to indicate "do not push to remote" and not safe for personal info
1. [[Worknotes vault | #worknotes-vault]] (why does [[#worknotes-vault]] render to the page title)
1. [[Shared Vault | #shared-vault]]
## Personal workspace
+ Peacock to have special color to indicate safe to push and safe for personal information, no work details
1. [[HomeNotes vault | #homenotes-vault]]
1. [[Shared Vault | #shared-vault]]
1. [[HomeProject vault 1 | #homeproject-vaults]] (1 - 3 of these)
1. [[HomeProject vault 2 | #homeproject-vaults]]

## Vaults
### WorkNotes vault 
+ Local git repo
+ See structure
> #### contacts - c.* (not a huge fan of c, but p is taken by projects)
>> I kinda would like to have all the contacts be in my shared vault, but see how I want to keep daily notes, too...
> #### daily
> #### intel - i.* (reference notes for work specific stuff)
> #### meetings - m.*
> #### projects - p.*
> #### todo

### Shared Vault 
+ Sync'd to github
+ Shared via OneDrive.
+ Will it be a problem if shared? Will each edit overwrite or will there be a prompt to reload or is there some nice merge?
+ Could be split into people and reference to be more correct with the naming
> #### games
> #### languages
> #### literature
> #### people (Primarily want this for the backlinks)
> #### technology
> #### science
> #### ...

### HomeNotes vault
+ Sync with github
+ Stored on OneDrive for easy sharing
+ Same questions as people vault
> #### projects - p.*
> #### daily
> #### todo

### HomeProject vaults
+ Likely to be 3 of them at a time
+ Mostly for things that I want to keep a separate knowledgebase for
+ Custom structure 
+ ex. Active books/stories that I'm writing
