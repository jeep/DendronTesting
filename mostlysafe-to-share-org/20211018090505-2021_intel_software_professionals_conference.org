* General comments
+ This is scheduled too tightly! Two five-minute breaks for the entire day. Day 2 went after 5:00
+ Didn't get much out of it, sadly. This conference has been decreasing in value over the last several years
+ Sound levels and other tech issues were a plague for the conference
+ Lightning talks- not enough time for most of them, so no real value. could have provided more value with full sessions
+ Lightning talks value is letting people know things exist, but for the most part these didn't point to other resources.
+ Sound levels were all over the place
+ Plagued with tech issues.
* Valuable (most were even interesting)
** Value-First Mindset: Career Development With a Twist
+ Michael Jacobson created a "destination meeting"
+ Focussed on One Intel
+ Don't talk about your tasks- talk about the value you provide, instead
*** Value-first mindset
+ What problems need to be solved
+ Skills and Experience are important to HOW you do something
+ Both are important, order isn't important, though.
+ Business acumen (Wikipedia definition)- An understanding of how you use your skills and experience to solve the customer problems
 * Need to use your expertise to address the problem- the knowledge isn't the goal
+ goto/iidf
**** What are you worth?
+ VRIO

** Day2 Keynote - The Tyranny of the Urgent (Career Development Topic)
+ full of survivor bias, but good advice generally
+ Make a plan and execute to it in order to progress in your career
** Intro from Pat Gelsinger [[id:7891011d-ed26-48a6-94fb-21570729bece][Pat Gelsinger]]
The primary focus was basically
+ One Intel
+ Torrid Pace
Nothing new for people who have been paying attention
** Building continuous quality into Python projects
+ Should have been a longer session. I think this could be interesting to follow up on.
*** How to ensure quality?
+ some can be checked by automated tools
+ lint and scan it early and often
+ "Continuous confidence" through quality Gates
  identify and prioritize unit testing of complicated code
+ Pybuilder is an open source buile automation tool for Python tools
*** Pybuilder
  +  platform agnostic
  +  simple API
  +  fast
  + Code quality metrics using several plug-ins
** Showing the benefits of Optane technology for RocksDB performance on Intel and competitive platforms (luca.giacchino@intel.com)
*** TODO rewatch Optane on RocksDB presentation
*** Optane in RocksDB
+ can use larger block cache
+ Contributed a new block cache
+ Tested using db_bench w/ 100% read workload Storage: 4NVMe drives, barlow pass dimms
+ Performance results shown 6x improvement going to P5800X PCIe Gen4 optaion vs PCIe Gen3 NAND
+ Storage cost per throughput remains the same
+ non-optane: AMD and Intel have comparable performance
+ With Optane- clear Intel benefit
+ Compared with ARM (ampere altra) Comparable throughput, Intel has 1/2 the latency
** Programmatic Control of a Compiler for Productive Performance across Spatial and Vector Architectures
+ Interesting content, maybe rewatch and reach out for more edification
* Very Interesting
** Charismatic Robots
+ Keynote from Heather Knight- social roboticist from Oregon State
+ Robots need to react as expected for the most part
+ The OSU food delivery robots caused confusion at intersections. Now they back up a bit to signal that the person or car can go.
+ CS student with robotics in their first year are more likely to graduate with that degree (statement made, not sourced/vetted)
+ Robots that operate around people need to prioritize what WE care about
+ People bond with machines

* Interesting
+ FW Validation using Change based validation
+ Hardening AI/ML workloads - Fun but felt more like an advertisement
+ A Comprehensive Co-optimization Framework for Deep Neural Networks on Intel Hardware
+ Machine Learning Assisted Context-based Battery Charging - found this very interesting
+ A Study on Static Code Analyzers in Data Attack Detection -  goto/dfa
+ Customer Quick Start Stack for Microservices on Intel DC & Edge Platforms - maybe better as a full session
+ Machine Learning Approach to Optimize Cache Prefetcher Aggressiveness at Run-Time in HPC System
+ Incorporating Elasticsearch and Kibana into a Software Development Automation - full session?
+ Contract testing with Docker Compose and OpenAPI as integration testing alternative
+ Performance analysis and optimal configuration of microservice architectures using Genetic Algorithm for x86-64 server platforms
+ Product Life After Launch-Long Term Retention and Support
* Sounds insteresting but missed some/most of it
+ TODO watch these in the background
+ Robust auto triage using quark
+ End to end performance projection for XeGPU with Quantum Espresso
+ Standardizing architecture and support for guest/VM live migration with PCI Device Suspend Capability
+ Experience-driven System Architecture Transformation with Entry Education Segment
+ Intel’s New Unified PLC and its Impact to Intel SW
+ It's a mess in the Service Mesh!
+ Improving Language Model Fine-tuning by Discovering Informative Contexts -Distracted but the parts I saw were interesting. Rewatch?
+ Migrating AutoDock-GPU, a Drug Screening Code to Data Parallel C++
* Didn't find value
+ Scalable IP initialization and error correction with binary and configurable data-based firmware approach through Firmware Support Package
+ Rust for C++ - looked forward to this, but was terribad
+ Identifying External Manufacturing Cost Savings Using Azure Cloud - all seemed obvious or trite
+ Better AI scheduling with Machine Learning Service - maybe better as full session?
+ (Historical) Bug Records ENabled Debug Assistant
+ TestSuite – Innovative way to Improve Val coverage & reduce significant automation time of FW testing with 100% automatable tests on Pre/Post silicon - Didn't seem all that innovative, maybe I don't grok
+ Software for AI: Challenges and opportunities
+ Broadcast’s Sequence of Scan Packets Optimization: A Significant Reduction of Test Time and Vector Memory
+ Validation Log Automation
* Missed but not interested
+ Scheduling on Intel Hybrid and Software Enabling
+ Growing Concern of Information Technologies: Cybersecurity
+ Enable Athena Intelligent Collaboration Features on Chrome using IPU and GPU Offloading
+ Missed day 3 11:45-12:35 talk session
+ Day 3 last block oF TeD talks
